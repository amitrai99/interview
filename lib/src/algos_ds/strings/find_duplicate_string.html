  <h1>Find duplicate characters in a String</h1>
  <p>All such problems fall under the <i>Element distinctness problem domain</i> See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_distinctness_problem</p>
  <b>It is not possible to find distinct elements in O(n). The minimum is O(nlog(n))</b>
  <p>1. Can be done easily using hashmaps.</p>
  <p>2. Another approach could be using a array with each position representing ascii char. Good for ascii or ISO_latin only. UTF is too large for this.</p>
