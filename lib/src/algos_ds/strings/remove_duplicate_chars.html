  <h1>Remove duplicate characters from String</h1>
  <p>This can mean 2 things. We either remove all the duplicates or just keep one instance of each char</p>
  <p><b>Approaches</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Use a map to count occurence. Complexity: O(n)
      <br/>In first loop create map
      <br/>In second loop check each char as key in map. If count > 1, delete char.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use an array 128 length for ascii chars. Complexity: O(n)
      <br/> Iterate and Read ascii code of char at location i. Update the count of char in array at index i.
      <br/> Iterate second time and delete all chars with count > 1
    </li>
  </ol>
