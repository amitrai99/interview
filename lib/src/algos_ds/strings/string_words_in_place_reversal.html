  <title>Reverse words of a string in place</title>
</head>
<body>
  <strong>In Place reversal is NOT possible in JavaScript because String is immutable.</strong>
  <p>
Reverse the string by swapping the first character with the last character,
the second character with the second‐to‐last character, and so on. Then, go through
the string looking for spaces, so that you find where each of the words is. Reverse
each of the words you encounter by again swapping the first character with the last
character, the second character with the second‐to‐last character, and so on.

    Using an intermediate array to hold the string and doing all the operation on it might be slightly more performant because you are not creating Strings constantly.
