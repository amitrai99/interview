  <h1>Create heap from a binary tree</h1>
  <p>
    This question is for testing your understanding of binray tree and another tree data structure called <strong>heap</strong>.
    Important point to remember is that we need to convert a <em>Binary Tree</em> which is not necessarily a Binary Search Tree.
  </p>
  <h2>What is a heap?</h2>
  <p>Heap is a type of tree based data sturcture with specific propery. There are two types of heap: <br/>
    (1) <strong>Max heap</strong> the parent node is always greater than child nodes.<br/>
    (2) <strong>Min heap</strong> the parent node is always smaller than child nodes.
  </p>
  <h3>To create a heap from a binary tree</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Traverse the binary tree and store the nodes in an array.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sort the array.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create a binary tree from the array. Every node has it's left at <em>2i + 1</em> and right at <em>2i + 2</em>.
    </li>
  </ol>
