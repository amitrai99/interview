# BNF (BACKUS NAUR FORM)

* Invented by John Backus and Peter Naur

* BNF is a formal mathematical way of defining syntax unambigously.
* It is a meta-language

It consists of:
* Terminal symbols
* Non-terminal symbols
* Production rules

## Format
```
LHS ::= RHS

LHS = Left hand side (Always a non-terminal symbol)
::= is defined by
RHS = Right hand side (Sequence of symbols terminal or non-terminals)
```
